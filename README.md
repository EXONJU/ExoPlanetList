# ExoPlanetList
List of hand-picked exoplanets

> Created for my Phd Dissertation.

###一些约定：

- mainly based on `exoplanet.org`
- name alias choose Simbad `main_id`
- `Kepler` prior to `KOI`
- binary star keep `A` and/or `B` within name
- avoid use aconyms like `alp` but `alpha`
- avoid special chars like `'`
- alpha ahead of number `Oph 11 b` instead of `11 Oph b`
- `K2` instead of `EPIC`
- `PH` instead of `Kepler`
- `KELT` instead of `WASP`
